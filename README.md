NavMesh Agents Follow System

Description:
This Unity project is focused on demonstrating the behavior of NavMeshAgent objects in Unity, specifically how they can effectively follow a leader agent. The implementation includes various approaches to following behavior, such as direct following, maintaining formation, and chaotic, random movement patterns. The system is versatile, allowing agents to adapt to the leader's movement dynamically.

Features:

Agents dynamically follow a designated leader.
Implementation of different follow behaviors including direct follow, formation, and random scatter.
Advanced use of Unity's NavMesh components.

How to Use:

Assign a leader agent and set its path or destination.
Add follower agents and link them to the leader agent.
Customize the follow behavior and parameters as needed.
Run the scene and observe how follower agents adapt to the leader's movement.
